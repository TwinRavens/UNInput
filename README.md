# UNInput Version 1.0

The name stands for Universal Network Input. This project focus on amplifying the support for multiple virtual and hardware controllers over network. It holds modular scripts that cover different sections of the framework such as: virtual controls, transmission, input registration and default UNInput static class (like Unity's Input static class).

## How to Use

You can check the [manual](https://github.com/TwinRavens/UNInput/blob/main/Assets/UNInput/UNInput%20Manual.pdf), though it might be a little outdated (nothing major though).
To import the asset to your project just copy the Plugins folder to it's Asset Folder. If you are using an Assembly for your scripts, don't forget to add UNInput Assembly as a reference as well.
